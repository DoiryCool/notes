## Introduction

Arduino is an opensource convenient,flexible and easy-to-use electronic platform,including hardware(various types of Arduino boards) and software (Arduino IDE).

## Advantages

* Cross-PlatformYou can run Arduino IDE on three major operating systems,Windows、Mac OS and Linux.
* Easy
  It's really easy!

## Common boards

* Arduino Nano

* Arduino Uno

* Arduino Mega
  I don't think you will use it and  if so,just google!

## How to Interpret these images?

As you see,these images all has a legend,which is colorful.Each color represents a protocol,for example,brown stands for digital pins and violet stands for the pins that can be used as analog pins.

What is digital and what is analog?We will learn it later and you just need to know digital is just 0 and 1;analog is a nubmer between 0 and 255 or more.
