# Introduction

This applet is useless, and i also don't konw what is it used for.
It includes the functions of login check and register, containing opencv that can open your computer camera, just for the beginner to learn how to combine Pyqt, sqlite ,opencv, python etc. together.

## 1.Enviroment

python3.x maybe all valid,but um not sure,You'd better use :`python >= 3.6`

And you must install following libraries.

```shell
pip install pyqt5-tools opencv-python
```

## 2.Problems
As i use VS Code wrote this applet,there is a path problem,causing some  `import` problems,so you shoud manually debug it.
