# 05.Oh,Interrupt,interrupt what this?
## Still the definition  
Interrupt stops the current work of the Arduino so that some other work can be completed.    
  
Suppose you are sitting at home and chatting with others. Suddenly the phone rang. You stop chatting and pick up the phone to talk to the caller. When you finish talking on the phone, you go back and chat with the person before the phone rang.  

Similarly, you can think of the main program as chatting with someone, and the ringing of the phone makes you stop chatting. The Interrupt Service Routine(SIR) is the process of talking on the phone. When the call is over, you return to the main program of your chat. This example explains exactly how interrupts cause the processor to perform operations.
The main program runs in the circuit and performs some functions. However, when an interruption occurs, the main program stops when another program is executed. When this program ends, the processor returns to the main program again.
